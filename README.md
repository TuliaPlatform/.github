Tulia Protocol
Overview
Tulia is a revolutionary peer-to-peer lending platform that offers users unparalleled control over their financial activities. Our platform allows users to create and manage their own lending pools, earning staking rewards while awaiting borrowers. This experimental protocol is designed to provide individual control and flexibility, but it is still in the testing phase.

Important Notice
Do not use this protocol in production. Tulia is currently experimental and not ready for production use. There are likely to be significant errors and the platform requires extensive testing and debugging.
